# Remote Dermatology Advisor Using Skin Image Analysis

## Project Overview
Skin disorders, ranging from minor irritations to life-threatening conditions like melanoma, impact millions worldwide. Early diagnosis is critical, yet access to dermatologists remains a challenge due to limited healthcare resources, cost barriers, and societal stigma.

This project proposes the development of a **"Remote Dermatology Advisor Using Skin Image Analysis"**, an AI-based mobile application designed to:
- Provide cost-effective and private diagnostic support for skin abnormalities.
- Leverage deep learning for accurate and real-time skin disease detection.
- Promote accessibility, inclusivity, and user privacy.
